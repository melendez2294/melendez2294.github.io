PS Tools

At work I was introduced to a bunch of handy commands from powershell. My
coworker mentioned how with powershell, you can log in and get access
to a computer on the network and string out a lot of information such as
last user logged in, computer name, accounts on the computer and more.
In order to be able to make that work properly, you will have to install 
PSTools. 

First, go to the link and download the required folder.

You move the downloaded folder into the root of your computer's C: drive.

Now, when you run cmd or powershell, you can type, "psexec" and the command will
be recognized. It is definitely a handy tool. On this link, at the bottom of the page
you can see the many uses it has. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/pstools
