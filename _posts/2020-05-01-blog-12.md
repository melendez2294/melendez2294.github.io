Microsoft Office 2010 + Office 2017 = ERROR

This week I had an intense experience. I thought I had ruined a director's office computer
because Microsoft Office had two different versions installed. I had installed Office 2017
to give him a newer version. Unfortunately his databases were not loading up. I had a 
similar encounter before so I believed I had to reinstall the older version first but it was not 
recognizing any of his files. When I would try to open word document, it kept saying 
"Installation in progress". 

It finally finished installing but then it was not accepting the license to activate. I had 
to completely uninstall everything, then reinstall the 2010 version. Afterwards, I had
to install the 2017 version. It finally took the keys and I was able to activate. Lastly,
I had to manually go in and disable all the 2010 applications other than excel so there
was no conflict. I was just extremely stressed because the director was on a time crunch and 
it took forever to get it done.
