This week at work I had to figure out why one of our city planner's computers were getting the blue screen of death. I was tasked with troubleshooting the error code. 
My main issues was to troubleshoot the different code it generated at the end. 

The code I kept capturing was "DRIVER IRQL_LESS_OR_NOT_EQUAL" and it was pointing at the iastorb.sys file. 

In order to take care of the issue, I went in to disable the RAID device on the computer, and uninstal the Intel Rapidshare Storage software.
After making sure that was cleaned up, I went in to run a check disk on the C: drive and make sure there were no other errors found.
Lastly to be safe, I went in to defrag and optimize the drive to clear any unnecessary file fragments and optimize drive speed. 

It was my first time troubleshooting that type of error and it was such a great feeling to finally be able to have it fixed. The user was greatful I 
did not have to reimage his computer.
