Google OpenSK

Google just announced that they have released an open source way of creeating personalized security keys. It consists of a 
FIDO2 authenticator and allows people to personalize and created a physical 2 way authenticator for online account rather than
having a one time code being sent to your phone or an email sent to confirm your identity. Security keys have become popular and 
many users have been switching over to this alternative as it is a lot more secure and users have more power as to what information
websites save. 

Google was a pioneer in terms of the first keys as they were coming out. They have a 'Titan' line of security keys that work as USB and
also a spare that works with Bluetooth connectivity. With that all being said, the idea behind helping with open source information is 
that they hope it catches on and enthusiasts around will help develop other features as well as helping it grow publicly. 

All you need to make your own security key is a Nordic chip dongle.

And lastly, if you have a 3D printer, Google provided some schematics on a key enclosure to protect your chip.
