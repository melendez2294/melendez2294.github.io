This week I have been working on my CIT 496 class mainly. We are creating virtual servers with a failover firewall configuration. My hardest thing so far has been to configure my machines together so they can keep communication going amongst each other. I was also having issues having my virtual machines on the same local area network but I finally figured that out in Virtualbox. As for my firewall configuration, I have looked into it with my group and I believe we will be using something called "Keepalive". I still have yet to understand how that fully works. For this class though, I will meet with my group tomorrow after class and we will discuss what is needed and move on from there. There hasnt been much more of an update as some of us had exams, but we will have something more concrete next week.
