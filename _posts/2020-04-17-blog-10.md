Hackintosh

I am extremely excited because with all the free time I have gained recently, I am going to
make a custom built desktop. I have not done so in a long time and this should be a fun
refresher. The main reason for me building (as if the title was not that obvious) is because
I want to build a PC that is capable of running Mac OS on it. The tricky part about this 
build is that the operating system is really specific to what it can run on. After many 
YouTube videos and threads about hackintosh walk throughs, I finally chose one to follow.
Here is the link to that website: https://www.tonymacx86.com/buyersguide/building-a-customac-hackintosh-the-ultimate-buyers-guide/#CustoMac_Pro

The tutorial has a ton of different options for parts, but I went with what was within my 
budget as well as to what was kind of necessary.  I have listed and linked what I recently purchased
for this build.

Motherboard I purchased was the ASUS ROG MAXIMUS XI HERO.

The recommended processor was any Intel Coffee Lake multicore processor. I went with an
Intel i5, 6- core with 3.7GHz.

The fan I ended up getting was the Thermaltake Slim X3.

As for memory, I decided I wanted 32GB and went with the Ballistix Sport LT.

I went with a 500GB Samsung SSD Drive.

Lastly, I ended up getting a Sapphire 8GB video card.

I just ordered these parts and I am excited because I have no experience with Mac OS and 
I felt in order for me to be more diverse, I should dabble with the bare minimum. I have a 
few things I want to do with this set up and make it my primary computer at home. I will be 
posting soon as to how the set up goes.
