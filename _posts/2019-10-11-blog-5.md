THis week I was working on the group project with my team. We got ahead early last week with all of the AWS configuration. This week I was helping with the webpage set up and then lastly I created the README.MD files. It was not an impossible task. I enjoyed working with my group. Everyone was very knowledgeable and I learned a lot from everyone.
