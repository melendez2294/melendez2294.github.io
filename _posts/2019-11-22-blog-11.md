This week, I had printer issues at work. One of the users was tring to print labels onto envelopes and for whatever reason, the printer was not printing in the desired area.
The printer was printing smack in the middle and no matter what we did in the Microsoft Word settings, it would not cooperate. I was looking into the printer configuration with 
my coworker and it all seemed correctly configured. Then, we went into the printer properties and we realized the settings looked a lot different from it normally should. 
After playing with the settings for a minute, we came to the realization that it was using a generic driver and that it was not allowing any sort of settings to be applied. 
In order to fix the issue, we did the following steps:

1. Open Control Panel
2. Click on "Devices and Printers"
3. We selected the proper printer
4. Right click and go to "Printer Properties"
5. Click on "Advanced" 
6. Click on "Driver"
7. Select proper "Driver"
8. Click "Apply"

After we did this, we set the envelope size in settings and then tried to print it again and it worked like a charm. We had no idea how much a driver really does for 
hardware that is used with computers. In my mind, I believed it was simply used to establish a connection and be recognized by the computer, but in reality
it does a whole lot more such as enable settings and allow devices to be used to full potential.
