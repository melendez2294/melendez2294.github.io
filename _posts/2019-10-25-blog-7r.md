This week was really hectic, I was trying to keep up with school work for other classes and the project with my team. THe harderst part was to meet up due to our work schedules. We also had outside responsibilites that we needed to tend too and made it diffcult. Overall, I was able to do my art on the project, work on the powerpoint presentation with a group partner all while maneuvering with my work schedule.
