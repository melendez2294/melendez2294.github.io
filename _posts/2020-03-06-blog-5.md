Shared Printer

At work I had a situation where I had to install a local printer and share it to 
another computer throught the network. I never actually knew that was something that could
be done. So what I did was first install the printer to the network computer. After that,
I went into settings of the printer and allowed to share and gave it a name. For the cubicle,
I named it 4th_Fl_Printer. 

Next I went to the computer I wanted to share the printer with and went to 
control panel. I went to install printer and clicked on printer was not showed. 
I selected shared printer and typed the computer name and the printer name and it worked.
