Google Chrome Bookmarks

At work the other day, I had to do a data transfer and install a new computer.
After having done that, I was emailed that the user was missing their bookmarks, which was accidentally missed.
Once we remove computers, we remove the hard drive and store them for six months in out storage room just in case files
are missing and the rest of the computer is sent back to our central service yard to be repurposed. Unfortunately, that morning,
the central service yard had sent techs to pick up the unused equipment and I was stuck with only the hard drive. I did not have another
computer to boot the drive in and extract the bookmarks was using. I came to a realization that somehow, some way, there had to be a way 
the hard drive stores them.

After some research, I found out there is a hidden folder with all that information. I booted the dard drive using a hard drive dock.
Once I opened file explorer to view the contents, I went to the view tab in the file explorer ribbon and checked the "Hidden items" box.
From there I navigated to the "Default" folder in chrome. "C:\Users\"YOUR USER ACCOUNT"\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default"
Once there, when you scroll to the bottom of the folder you can find a "Bookmarks" file. I copied that over to a flashdrive and then 
went to the user's computer and navigated to the same folder but on the new machine. I pasted the file and restarted Google Chrome and it
worked like a charm.
