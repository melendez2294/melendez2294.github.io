Hiren's BootCD Bootable USB

Ever since I can remember, the Hiren's BootCD has been a very popular tool in the industry. 
When I was taking A+ prep courses, it was something that every instructor preached we had to have 
on us, that is why I will be explaining why it is useful as well as how to make a bootable 
USB drive.

The latest version of the Hiren's BootCD that I found was actually a fan built PE (preinstalled
environment) version. It still has all the amazing freeware that the last official version had
when it came out in 2012, but it is current and it was aimed towards new age computers. Below is a
list of what kind of tools come in this version:

BCD-MBR Tools
Hard Disk Tools – Data Recovery
Hard Disk Tools – Defrag
Hard Disk Tools – Diagnostic
Hard Disk Tools – Disk Explorer
Hard Disk Tools – Imaging
Hard Disk Tools – Partition Tools
Hard Disk Tools – Security
Windows Recovery
Freeware Tools
Removable Drive Tools
Security – AntiVirus
Security – KeyFinders
Security – Passwords
System Tools
Network

Now, to create the bootable, you first download the Hiren's BootCD ISO file. It can be followed
here: https://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/. Next, you download an ISO burner. The one I use is
the one recommended by the website which is ISO2USB. The download link to that is: 
https://www.hirensbootcd.org/files/ISO2USB.exe. Its simple to use that is why I recommend it.
It detects your flash drive for USB Device. Then you give it a name or label. Lastly, you choose 
the recently downloaded ISO file. Make sure to check mark "Format Selected USB Device" and
"Copy ISO COntent to USB Device". Lastly, cick on proceed. A window will pop up to ask if you are
sure, you click on "Yes" and you should have a new USB Bootable Hiren's BootCD.
