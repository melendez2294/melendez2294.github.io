Hiren's BootCD Bootable USB

Ever since I can remember, the Hiren's BootCD has been a very popular tool in the industry. 
When I was taking A+ prep courses, it was something that every instructor preached we had to have 
on us, that is why I will be explaining why it is useful as well as how to make a bootable 
USB drive.

The latest version of the Hiren's BootCD that I found was actually a fan built PE (preinstalled
environment) version. It still has all the amazing freeware that the last official version had
when it came out in 2012, but it is current and it was aimed towards new age computers. Below is a
list of what comes in this version:
