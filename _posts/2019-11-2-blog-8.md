This week, there was an incident at work where our systems team were notified of two users who had been flagged with malware. In order to avoid any further infection, we 
had to go to the department where the computers were located and search the floors to located them. The good thing, we are able to see what the computer service tags were.
The not so good thing is that we had no way of knowing location of each tower, so it was going in and checking each computer one by one.

When we finally found the PCs, we had to shut it down and take them back to the shop. To take care of the issue, we disconnected the HDD, and plugged it into a HDD Dock.
After, we plugged it into a test computer we have with no connection to the internet. We conducted multiple scans to quarintine any type of malware. After catching the 
infected files, we looked at where they were pointing and documented what it was and which profile it was caught in. That information would go to the higher IT administration
and they would see what to do after. The PCs were placed back once we were sure it was completely clean.
