This week, I had a situation at work where MANY of the computers on each of the 4 floors I help oversee had issues with Google Chrome. Users were panicking
and believed we were having an internet outage and the world was going to end because they could not connect to the internet. I do agree, it is pretty scary
when almost everyone has this problem and one by one, they start being phoned in. It was hectic because it was an issue with Google Chrome itself. It automatically
updated itself to a newer version (as Google have automatic updates set without a rollback option). This caused a conflict with our Symantec Security settings so 
Chrome was actually forbidden to connect online. All it did was came back with an "Aw snap!" message.

The work around solution we came up with is to run Chrome in a "safe mode" type of way. We had to go into properties and disable the internal sandbox. By doing so, it runs 
without security features set from Google. So what we did to get this done, we had to go into "Properties" and on the "Target" address, at the verry end, we add 
-no-sandbox. It allowed the program to connect and users were able to get back online. I do not know how it will be changed afer we do have Chrome working with our 
Symantec, but that was what how we were told to handle the situation.
