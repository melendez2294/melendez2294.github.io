This week I was working on beginning the Ansible Playbook. I did not get very far as I was still trying to work on the previous lab. I know it no longer is worth points but I still am very interested in learning how to get it done. The hard part for me this week was to get the project started. I am also taking CIT 496 and I was caught up on creating a failover firewall on two linux servers and that was also taking up a lot of my research time. MY plan is to definitely get things moving tomorrow and finish the first part of the lab and begin to create the second playbook by midweek next week.
