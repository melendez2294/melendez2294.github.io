Telecommute

These last few weeks have been a little overwhelming due to the situation we are in as well as the high demand there is at 
work to help and assist people with telcommuting. With my job at the city and the state of emergency we are in, we have been
working more hours to assist people within the city to be able to work from home through multiple devices. I have had people bring
their personal laptops and tablets to me to set up their vpn so they are allowed to rdp. 

So what I have to do is install a program that we use to create a secure connection from any network the personal PC is connected to.
The program is called ZScaler, and the accounts are made through our higher IT division. Theyre made specifically for the needs of the
city but they are a private VPN company. Next we use the computer's Remote Desktop COnnection program to connect to the office computer.
We need the computers exact name as well as the user's credentials for that specefic computer.
