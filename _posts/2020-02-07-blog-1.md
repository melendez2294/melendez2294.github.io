Windows God Mode

The other day at work I was trying to find specific settings and I was having a hard time finding them in the control panel.
My coworker was working on a similar computer and was able to finish within minutes. When I asked him how he was able to navigate to the settings within control panel, he 
bursted out laughing and showed me a nice little tweak that is a lot easier to get to setting and it is all sorted by categories. This tweak is called God Mode.

In order to access this feature, you have to follow three simple steps:
1. Make sure your system account has administrative privileges
2. Right-click on the Windows 10 desktop and choose New > Folder
3. Name the folder: GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}

You can literally name this feature anything by changing the "GodMode" in front of the folder name. 
Below is a link to an image of what the folder looks like.

It may not be the most exciting thing as the name suggests, but it is super useful at my workplace and something I tend to use daily now.
