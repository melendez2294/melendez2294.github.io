This week I was scheduled to work on Windows 10 migrations. I had done many before, but I had a situation where I was using a HDD image that was not booting up.
I ended up trying another HDD and to my surprise, it also did not load up either. I had a whole box of images for this computer model type (Dell Optiplex 7040).
After my third hard drive test and no luck, I thought I might have made a mistake when making the images at our cloning tower, so I called another tech and explained the  
issue. 

Apparently, with this specific computer model, we had to go into the BIOS to switch from Legacy Boot to UEFI Boot. I had no idea what the differenece was or why it had to
be changed. So I ended up doing a little research to find out exactly why it mattered and how it came to play. I found out it actually is a replacement for BIOS itself.
UEFI is a newer type of software that allows graphics such as mouse cursors in the boot menu as well as being light enough to provide a quicker boot time and more 
security functions. It also supports larger HDDs exceeding 2TB. Big companies apparently have it listed as "BIOS" to avoid confusion, but UEFI is a whole separate
software on its own.
