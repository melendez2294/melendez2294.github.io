Microsoft Office Rollback

At my job this week I had a weird situation where a user had issues with their Microsoft Access. After reviewing their setup I realized
they had two different versions of office programs installed. They had the 2013 suite and ONLY 2010 Access which I found peculiar.
My coworker who thought it was a simple reinstall crashed the setup because she thought it was the 2013 version locking up the 2010 Access
so she uninstalled it. After trying to reinstall it would not run because it was a 32 bit Access that was installed and it had to be
uninstalled.

To remedy the issue, I first custom installed office 2013 with only the basics. Then I went in and installed Access 2010. It was simple 
to fix, but when you are not too sure and the setups refuse to run it becomes a headache to figure out, especially during pay periods
and the user needs to get a hold of their databases instantly.

So just note on what I learned, install the new version first.
